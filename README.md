# YOLOv8-ObjectDetection-DL

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8)** for object detection as part of the **Deep Learning and Neural Networks course (DVA307)** at Mälardalen University, 2025.

The lab focuses on understanding object detection frameworks, training a YOLO model, and evaluating its performance on image datasets.

## Objectives

* Understand the principles of **object detection** with deep learning.
* Set up and train a **YOLOv8 model** using PyTorch and Ultralytics.
* Experiment with hyperparameters and evaluate detection performance.
* Visualize bounding boxes and class predictions.

---

## Tech Stack

* Python
